Using ARIMA (AutAutoregressive Integrated Moving Averages)
The general process for ARIMA models is the following:

1. Get the Data 
2. Clean the Data 
3. Visualize the Time Series Data 
4. Make the time series data stationary 
5. Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts 
6. Construct the ARIMA Model 
7. Use the model to make predictions
